- Led a team of 4–5 engineers through the full modernisation of a legacy 3270 terminal-based
  system to an internet-facing, cloud-native web application — eliminating the dependency on
  trained operators and opening the platform to end users for the first time.
- Migrated the OEM's internal employee leasing programme onto the platform, enabling all
  employees of the German subsidiary to self-manage vehicle handover and return appointments
  — a major shift in reach and accessibility.
- Took the platform from a near-frozen codebase maintained by a single engineer to a 3-week
  release cadence; migrated infrastructure from mainframe hardware to AWS and expanded
  rollout to 5 locations.
- First role leading a team of this size — responsible for architecture, technical decisions,
  and people management end to end.

## Additional context (not yet on site, add when numbers are confirmed)
- Ballpark users: tens of non-registered end users, hundreds of appointments via dealerships/trained staff
- 5 locations: first 3 at launch, 2 more added with the member programme
- Deployment: ~3-week cadence vs. near-zero before (single maintainer approaching retirement)
- Stack: Kotlin + Vue.js, AWS (Kubernetes, Kafka, NoSQL), Terraform
