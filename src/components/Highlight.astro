          The project started as a migration — a legacy 3270 mainframe terminal used for capacity
          management and product information in the after-sales domain, maintained by a single
          engineer approaching retirement. We replaced it with an internet-facing, cloud-native
          web application that anyone could use without training.

          What I'm most proud of isn't the technology. It's what the platform became. After the
          initial migration, we expanded to five locations, absorbed the OEM's internal employee
          leasing programme, and opened the platform to end users managing their own vehicle
          handovers and returns — a user group that would never have touched the old system.

          We went from a near-frozen codebase to releasing every three weeks. From mainframe
          hardware to AWS. From one maintainer to a team of five. It was the first time I led
          a team of that size, and it's the project that best represents how I like to work —
          close to the people, close to the problem, and building something that outlasts the
          engagement.
