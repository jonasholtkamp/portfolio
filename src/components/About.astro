        I'm a backend-focused software engineer with deep experience in cloud infrastructure,
        distributed systems, and the kind of platform work that keeps everything running but
        rarely makes it onto a slide deck.

        At Senacor, I spent nine years as Lead Developer — leading a feature team inside an
        agile delivery setup. That means I know how to design architecture and how to work with
        the people implementing it. I thrive in collaborative environments and I've been told
        I'm easy to be around.

        Currently working as an individual contributor at codejoi, focused on cloud,
        infrastructure, and application engineering.

        I don't have a LinkedIn. This is it.
