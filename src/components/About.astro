      <p class="text-ink">Over a decade in. Still enjoying it.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a backend-focused software engineer with deep experience in cloud infrastructure,
        distributed systems, and the kind of platform work that keeps everything running but
        rarely makes it onto a slide deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Senacor, I spent nine years as Lead Developer — leading a feature team inside an
        agile delivery setup. That means I know how to design architecture and how to work with
        the people implementing it. I thrive in collaborative environments and I've been told
        I'm easy to be around.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently at codejoi, working as an SRE and cloud engineer embedded in a platform team
        in the fintech sector.

        Agentic AI coding tools are part of how I work — Claude Code specifically. I've found
        that knowing when not to trust it is at least half the skill, and a decade of engineering
        judgement tends to help with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love the outdoors — long distance running with a passion for marathons, hiking, and gravel riding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about the work I take on. I'm drawn to companies with a genuine commitment to
        ESG and social responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a LinkedIn. This is it.
